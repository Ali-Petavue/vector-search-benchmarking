Just some decisions to be made in this, you know, because like we almost hit that scale, we don't want to rework again, you know, by choosing a wrong charting library here. So if we go with high charts, my question is, you know, will that work forever? You know, at least for next one year with all these data points or if it is plot legs, we can go with lots like one just before implementing anything.
