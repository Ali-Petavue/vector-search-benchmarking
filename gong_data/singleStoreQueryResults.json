So I would, and I'm happy to have another conversation with you as well, but I think, yeah, bringing it all together. So is the data and analytics team overall, right? This is, I've seen it in many organizations and we're bringing everything together through like a platform like Tableau or, you know, whatever power BI you bring it all together. But the way you bring it together is either through code, you're writing it or you're manually people are putting it together. So if you could solve that problem, I think that's interesting. The other piece that is, you know, a lot of companies have like data lakes, right? So you're trying to get all the data into one data lake, but it's always hard to extrapolate the information from that. So I feel like this doesn't necessarily need to be for one department. If there's a way you bring it all together where it's marketing sales ops, like it's a lot of data you bring together. But I feel like if you can do that, that's better than maybe what a sales Salesforce can do, right? Because Salesforce is… \n",

Hopefully you can relate to that, right? So what I'm also what I also like here is I don't have to ask this question in a repeated manner. What I mean by that is, for example, my first question was show me all the renewals that's coming up in this quarter or next quarter, that is somewhere at some risk, right? So that's the question, this question I can ask in every quarter, right? So it could be templatized so it can be repeatable. My next level source is my director, right? So my director is asking the same question but it's by CSM, right? So each CSM, let's say, Natalie is my director and she has a 15 csms under her. It can be broken down by csms, right? So if you think of this from a B to B perspective, there are sometimes predefined questions, right? Right? Like today, if I have to get this number, I have to go to my data scientist team. I have to submit a JIRA ticket. It is done, but they're only looking at data sources that they have access to and where I was struggling, they were doing this purely by Salesforce data and product usage data, Salesforce data, talks about the renewal date and all that stuff. Product data is logins, how many experiences created that looks at it. I'll give you a real life example. There was a gong sentiment and mentioned where one of my customers said, I'm gonna put path factory on hold for the next three months because I'm gonna focus on a web strategy, right? Very similar to KPMG for example, you said, I'm gonna implement Salesforce. So I'm gonna put this on the backbone of a little bit. We can easily say, yeah, zara is focusing on something or that person is focusing on something and let it go. But from my perspective, from a business that is a sentiment and I mentioned that I'll put it at some risk. And then I will add it to my thing. And then it also goes back to my ticketing system, right? Like how many tickets this account have submitted? More ticket is issue zero ticket is also issued because they are not raising anything, right? So now, these are all information that is sitting at different things by integrating this information in a view. When I ask this question, it is looking at five different data sources at least for path factory. And then it is telling me that these are accounts that's renewing in this quarter or next quarter. This is what you need to consider this. Risk also, I can say a simple question that Marketo data too rather than going to my Marketo team and asking like, hey tell me something, I can say how many of these customers who have customer contacts are opening our release notes, and for example, a newsletters, right? That could also tell me that this person is actually engaging with some of my thing, right? So, these are all this data sources which is completely sitting as a standalone information, but is helping me to understand you know, something about a business decision. And I need to make our goal at path factory is to templatize these deep dives and schedule this as reports. So we are not waiting for somebody to type. We are actually going to automate some of these team to obviously I can deep dive on a scheduled report. But the goal here is for me to, you know, automate some of these things because we know the business users, how they will use it. So that is what I'm thinking and obviously Prasanna is working on a lot of these things. But from the first look how we are unifying this data, how we are transforming the, and how we are going to predict this data? I just any thoughts, feedback on this one. So. \n",
